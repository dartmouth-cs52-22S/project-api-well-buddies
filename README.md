# Platform REST API Lab With Authentification

This lab creates a REST API that allows users to log in and sign up. Only authenticated users are allowed to create posts. At the bottom of each posts (once you click on a post), you can see the name of the author who first wrote it, but all authenticated users are able to edit any post.

## What Worked Well

Overall, implementing sign in and sign up went very smoothly, and so did adding author to posts. 

## What Didn't

One thing that I struggled with was that I initially saved by AUTH_SECRET in the incorrect format, and it took me a while to figure out that that was why I was umablne to get things to work
